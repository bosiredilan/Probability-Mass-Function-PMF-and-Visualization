# Probability-Mass-Function-PMF-and-Visualization
A Probability Mass Function (PMF) shows the probability distribution of a discrete variable by assigning a probability to each possible outcome. It is calculated by dividing the frequency of each value by the total number of observations. Visualizing the PMF with a bar chart or histogram makes it easy to see which outcomes are most likely.
